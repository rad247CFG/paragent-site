            <h1>Housing Affordability</h1>

            <p><strong>How artificial scarcity, not markets, broke urban housing</strong></p>

            <p>For most of modern history, urban housing was broadly market-linked. Over time, prices tracked wages, construction costs, and local demand. Real estate was not cheap, but it was usually attainable. Housing markets cleared.</p>

            <p>Over the last two generations, that relationship broke.</p>

            <p>In major cities, house prices have grown far faster than wages. Home ownership has moved out of reach for large portions of the population. Rent consumes an increasing share of income. Mobility has collapsed. This is not a natural outcome of capitalism or urbanisation. It is a historical anomaly.</p>

            <p>The cause is artificial scarcity.</p>

            <p>Specifically: centralised urban authorities that refuse to release sufficient land, impose high-risk, slow, discretionary planning processes, and externalise infrastructure costs while blocking development. Housing has not become expensive because it is hard to build. It has become expensive because permission to build has been rationed.</p>

            <p>This is not market failure.<br>It is institutional Fuckwittery.</p>

            <h2>How Artificial Scarcity Is Created</h2>

            <p>Urban housing scarcity is not accidental. It is produced by a consistent set of decisions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>land release is restricted</li>
                <li>zoning is frozen or politicised</li>
                <li>approvals are slow, uncertain, and appeal-heavy</li>
                <li>infrastructure provision is delayed or unfunded</li>
                <li>development risk is transferred to private actors without corresponding authority</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Local authorities block supply while refusing responsibility for expansion costs. Developers face multi-year delays, regulatory roulette, and retrospective rule changes. Capital prices this risk in. Fewer projects proceed. Prices rise.</p>

            <p>The system then blames "the market".</p>

            <p>This is backward.</p>

            <h2>Why Demand-Side Fixes Make It Worse</h2>

            <p>When housing becomes unaffordable, governments reach for demand-side interventions: first-home buyer grants, rent subsidies, tax concessions, and price caps.</p>

            <p>These policies feel compassionate. They are mechanically destructive.</p>

            <p>Subsidising buyers in a supply-constrained market does not improve affordability. It bids prices up. Sellers capture the subsidy. Scarcity tightens further.</p>

            <p>This pattern has repeated so reliably that it should no longer be debated.</p>

            <h2>Rent Control</h2>

            <p><strong>A policy that converts scarcity into permanence</strong></p>

            <p>Rent control is presented as a humane response to unaffordable housing. In reality, it freezes the symptom while institutionalising the disease.</p>

            <p>Rent control caps the price of a scarce good without increasing its supply.</p>

            <p>In administratively constrained housing markets, this produces a predictable sequence:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>price signals are suppressed</li>
                <li>new construction becomes unviable</li>
                <li>maintenance is deferred</li>
                <li>allocation shifts from market to power</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Scarcity does not disappear. It becomes opaque and entrenched.</p>

            <h2>What Rent Control Actually Does Well</h2>

            <p>Rent control does provide real, narrow benefits:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>it stabilises incumbent renters</li>
                <li>it reduces short-term displacement</li>
                <li>it dampens volatility during acute shocks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Used temporarily, it can act as a pause button during crises.</p>

            <p>The failure occurs when an emergency measure becomes permanent policy.</p>

            <h2>Incumbent Protection, Not Affordability</h2>

            <p>Rent control does not help renters as a class. It helps incumbent renters.</p>

            <p>It redistributes from:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>future renters to current ones</li>
                <li>mobile workers to immobile households</li>
                <li>housing quality to nominal affordability</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Access becomes a lottery. Mobility collapses. New entrants are excluded.</p>

            <p>Housing becomes a lifetime prize for those already inside.</p>

            <h2>The Maintenance Collapse</h2>

            <p>When returns are capped, investment exits.</p>

            <p>Landlords respond rationally:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>defer repairs</li>
                <li>avoid upgrades</li>
                <li>exit where possible</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cities with long-standing rent control regimes exhibit predictable decay. Nominal affordability is preserved while real habitability deteriorates.</p>

            <h2>The New Supply Problem</h2>

            <p>Rent control suppresses construction through:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>capped returns</li>
                <li>regulatory uncertainty</li>
                <li>capital flight</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Developers price in the risk that controls will expand or apply retroactively. Marginal projects die first. Scarcity deepens. Political pressure increases.</p>

            <p>This is the failure ratchet.</p>

            <h2>Why Rent Control Persists</h2>

            <p>Rent control survives because it looks like justice.</p>

            <p>It appears to force a transfer from the rich (owners) to the poor (tenants). The antagonist is visible. The beneficiary is visible. The costs are delayed and diffuse.</p>

            <p>But the real transfer is positional, not moral.</p>

            <p>Many landlords are not rich. Many protected tenants are not poor. The policy redistributes based on tenure, not need.</p>

            <p>It feels like redistribution without taxation. That makes it politically irresistible.</p>

            <h2>Rent Control and Welfare Share the Same Failure Mode</h2>

            <p>Both rent control and welfare function as episodic stabilisers, not permanent designs.</p>

            <p>Used briefly, they:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>prevent collapse</li>
                <li>absorb shocks</li>
                <li>buy time</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Used indefinitely, they:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>detach outcome from effort</li>
                <li>suppress adaptation</li>
                <li>reward incumbency</li>
                <li>require continual expansion</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Scarcity and failure are managed forever instead of resolved.</p>

            <h2>The Core Design Error</h2>

            <p>Rent control assumes the problem is pricing power.</p>

            <p>The real problem is supply suppression.</p>

            <p>Capping prices without fixing land release, infrastructure funding, planning delay, and approval risk is equivalent to placing a lid on a boiling pot while turning up the heat.</p>

            <p>Pressure builds. The system fails elsewhere.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Works</h2>

            <p>If the objective is affordability, the solution is not subtle:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>release land predictably</li>
                <li>permit density by default</li>
                <li>require developers to fund and gift infrastructure</li>
                <li>reduce approval discretion</li>
                <li>compress timelines</li>
                <li>make rules explicit and stable</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Price signals must be preserved. Supply must be allowed to respond.</p>

            <p>Anything else is theatre.</p>

            <h2>Closing</h2>

            <p>Urban housing is unaffordable because institutions engineered scarcity and then refused responsibility for its consequences.</p>

            <p>Rent control does not fix this.<br>Subsidies do not fix this.<br>Moral narratives do not fix this.</p>

            <p>They stabilise incumbents while locking out the future.</p>

            <p>Housing affordability will not return until centralised authorities stop rationing permission, stop externalising infrastructure costs, and stop treating scarcity as a moral problem instead of a mechanical one.</p>

            <p>This is not a market failure.</p>

            <p>It is institutional Fuckwittery.</p>

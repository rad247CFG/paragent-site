            <h1>Steering 1 — Toward Agency</h1>

            <p><strong>Steer toward actions that increase future optionality and away from those that reduce it—yours, and the system's.</strong></p>

            <p>The first Steering of Paragentism is to move toward agency. Doing so requires accepting an uncomfortable premise: the world is not fair, and it never has been. Complaining about this achieves nothing. What matters is how one acts within that reality.</p>

            <p>Agency is not the pursuit of advantage at any cost. It is the discipline of preserving the ability to act intelligently later. Actions that feel virtuous in the moment—compliance, deference, patience—often reduce future optionality. Actions that increase optionality may look unfair. When done correctly, this is neither immoral nor pathological. It is how differentiation occurs.</p>

            <h2>The Fairness Instinct</h2>

            <p>Most people carry an implicit contract with the world: effort should translate into outcome. Work hard, take reasonable risks, cooperate, persist, and eventually the system will allow a measure of sovereignty. Not dominance. Not excess. Just independence.</p>

            <p>This belief feels reasonable. It is also wrong.</p>

            <p>Unfairness is not a defect of modern systems. It is a property of reality. Two identical trees sprout at the same time. One is closer to water. Another has better soil. The advantage compounds. No malice. No injustice. No referee. Differentiation emerges naturally.</p>

            <p>Unfairness is not a moral failure. It is the mechanism by which outcomes diverge.</p>

            <h2>When Fairness Becomes Ideology</h2>

            <p>Because unfairness is uncomfortable, we attempt to correct it conceptually. When fairness becomes an ideology rather than a local coordination tool, three things happen:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Judgment is outsourced ("the system will sort this out").</li>
                <li>Power is ignored ("effort should be enough").</li>
                <li>Agency is delayed ("it would be wrong to act differently").</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each of these narrows future optionality. Over time, people become compliant rather than effective, and systems become stable rather than capable.</p>

            <h2>The Failure of Rules</h2>

            <p>Rules exist to simplify judgment. They offer consistency, predictability, and moral cover: if I followed the rule, I did the right thing. For a time, this works.</p>

            <p>Then reality moves to the edge of the rule, where rules always fail.</p>

            <p>Rules are designed for the centre of the distribution. Life reliably happens at the margins. When rules replace judgment, responsibility is externalised and agency decays. What feels like virtue becomes abdication.</p>

            <p>The Steerings are not rules. They exist precisely because rules cannot handle context, scale, and consequence.</p>

            <h2>The Gardner Perrott Case</h2>

            <p>Gardner Perrott was a small division of Brambles Limited responsible for sandblasting and painting large steel structures. The author's role was to generate new business. The official system was non-functional: no pricing authority, no differentiation, no estimating capability, and no training. "We're Gardner Perrott" was the only value proposition.</p>

            <p>After generating approximately $5 million in opportunities and closing almost nothing, a ninety-day ultimatum was issued. The failure was framed as personal. The system itself was the problem.</p>

            <p>With no viable alternative, agency was exercised. Estimating was self-taught. Production rates and material usage were learned. Jobs were costed independently. No permission was given. None was possible.</p>

            <p>The breakthrough came with a feedlot client comparing three bids. Gardner Perrott's price was highest. The client wanted the work done but could not justify the premium. Instead of discounting, the only relevant question was asked: what would make this offer genuinely better?</p>

            <p>The job existed to prevent corrosion. Instead of the standard twelve-month retention and defect liability, a five-year warranty was proposed, with staged retention over that period. This reframed the job around its true purpose. The offer became structurally superior.</p>

            <p>The warranty was unauthorised. When the purchase order arrived, management objected. The justification used the company's own language against it: "But we're Gardner Perrott."</p>

            <p>The job was delivered profitably. Within ninety days, over $600,000 was sold. The following year exceeded $1.25 million. The system had not changed. Judgment had.</p>

            <p><strong>Breaking the rule was not immoral. It was the only agency-preserving move available.</strong></p>

            <h2>The Lesson</h2>

            <p>Paragentism does not promise fairness, justice, or proportional reward. It begins from a more honest question: given an unfair world, how does an individual increase agency without becoming predatory, delusional, or morally anaesthetised?</p>

            <p>That question cannot be answered by rules, slogans, or systems.<br>It can only be answered where action occurs.</p>

            <p>Steering Toward Agency is the refusal to surrender that responsibility.</p>

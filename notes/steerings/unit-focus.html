            <h1>Steering 6 — Unit Focus</h1>

            <p><strong>Apply effort only at levels where agency still compounds.</strong></p>

            <p>Agency is not applied in a vacuum. It is expended at a particular unit&mdash;the self, a relationship, a team, an organisation, or a broader arena such as an industry or jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>The central failure this steering addresses is misallocation: applying effort at a level where agency no longer functions.</p>

            <p>Effort is finite. When applied at the wrong unit, it does not merely fail to improve outcomes&mdash;it actively erodes future agency. Time is consumed. Status stagnates. Optionality narrows. What looks like perseverance is often just friction misread as virtue.</p>

            <p>The correct unit of focus is the smallest level at which effort still reliably converts into future agency&mdash;status, resources, leverage, or optionality.</p>

            <p>Steering 6 is not about confrontation, exit, or self-improvement by default.<br>It is about diagnosis: deciding where effort belongs&mdash;and where it should be withdrawn.</p>

            <h2>Why Unit Focus Matters</h2>

            <p>Many problems that feel personal are structural.<br>Many that feel systemic are personal.</p>

            <p>Trying to fix yourself inside a system that cannot respond is as futile as trying to reform a system when the real issue is internal misalignment. Both waste agency.</p>

            <p>Compounding requires leverage. When leverage collapses, persistence stops being virtuous and becomes self-erosion. Opportunity cost accelerates this: effort spent here cannot be spent elsewhere, and the cost of staying is usually delayed, asymmetric, and invisible until exit becomes forced.</p>

            <p>Steering 6 exists to prevent:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>self-blame where leverage is external</li>
                <li>over-persistence where compounding has stopped</li>
                <li>moral rationalisation of staying too long</li>
                <li>exits that come late, not early</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is forward-looking and instrumental. Direction matters more than position. Vector matters more than speed.</p>

            <h2>The Method: Six Smooth Moves</h2>

            <p>Six Smooth Moves is the Paragentist method for diagnosing unit focus. It is not a checklist or a sequence. It is a set of considerations you can enter or exit at any point.</p>

            <p>The question it answers is simple:</p>

            <p><strong>Where should effort be focused&mdash;or withdrawn&mdash;right now?</strong></p>

            <h3>1. Check Self</h3>

            <p>Is this primarily an internal misalignment? Would better integration of intent, emotion, skill, or subconscious drivers materially restore leverage? This move prevents trying to fix the world when the problem is internal.</p>

            <h3>2. Check Focus</h3>

            <p>If not internal, is the problem mislocated? Does the issue live in a relationship, a group dynamic, or a structural constraint rather than the self? This move prevents unnecessary self-blame.</p>

            <h3>3. Check Leverage</h3>

            <p>Do you have usable leverage here&mdash;status or resourcefulness? Does effort at this level increase future leverage, or is it being driven by hope, habit, or moral pressure? Persistence without leverage is erosion.</p>

            <h3>4. Check Opportunity Cost (TERMS)</h3>

            <p>What is staying consuming across:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Time</li>
                <li>Emotion</li>
                <li>Risk</li>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>Status</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The most dangerous costs are delayed and invisible. This move makes them explicit.</p>

            <h3>5. Check Fuckwits</h3>

            <p>Is the system selecting for Fuckwits? Is competence penalised, failure promoted, or ideology substituting for feedback?</p>

            <p>This is not moral judgement&mdash;it is signal detection. Some systems cannot respond. No-Fuckwits is a focus decision, not purity politics.</p>

            <h3>6. Check Arena</h3>

            <p>Is the problem at the wrong level entirely? Would changing role, organisation, industry, or jurisdiction restore agency?</p>

            <p>Exit is not failure when effort no longer compounds.</p>

            <p>The process stops as soon as leverage is absent, opportunity cost dominates, Fuckwittery is entrenched, or arena misalignment is clear. No further justification is required.</p>

            <h2>Mini Case &mdash; How Politics Selects Out Agency</h2>

            <p>A senior professional was working inside a large organisation. Her work was consistently strong, visible, and valuable. Over time, however, credit for that work was routinely absorbed upward by her manager.</p>

            <p>Nothing illegal occurred. No formal rule was broken. The organisation continued to function normally. From the outside, it appeared healthy.</p>

            <p>Internally, something else was happening.</p>

            <p>The system rewarded political behaviour over contribution. Credit flowed not to those who produced value, but to those best positioned to narrate it. Leadership tolerated this as &ldquo;just how things work.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Applying Six Smooth Moves clarified the dynamics:</p>

            <p><strong>Check Self:</strong> No skill gap or internal misalignment explained the outcome.</p>

            <p><strong>Check Focus:</strong> The issue was not performance, but a political extraction pattern.</p>

            <p><strong>Check Leverage:</strong> Formal escalation offered little leverage; status already flowed upward.</p>

            <p><strong>Check Opportunity Cost:</strong> Time and reputation were being consumed without compounding.</p>

            <p><strong>Check Fuckwits:</strong> Political actors were promoted; capable contributors were quietly drained.</p>

            <p><strong>Check Arena:</strong> The organisation selected for politics over agency.</p>

            <p>Persistence would not have restored agency. It would have normalised extraction.</p>

            <p>She left.</p>

            <p>Within a year, she joined a smaller organisation where contribution and credit were tightly coupled. Her status, autonomy, and optionality increased materially.</p>

            <p>The organisation she left also changed&mdash;but not for the better.</p>

            <p>As people with agency exited, those who remained were disproportionately:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>tolerant of politics</li>
                <li>skilled at impression management</li>
                <li>willing to trade long-term outcomes for short-term positioning</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Leadership interpreted the exits as &ldquo;fit issues.&rdquo; In reality, the system had begun selecting for Fuckwits.</p>

            <p>This is the hidden cost of corporate political bullshit.</p>

            <p>When leaders permit or exhibit it, they do not create stability.<br>They create a selection filter.</p>

            <p>Agency leaves first.<br>What remains is compliant, performative, and politically optimised&mdash;and progressively incapable of real work.</p>

            <p>Steering 6 exists to help recognise this pattern early, while exit is still optional and agency can still be preserved.</p>

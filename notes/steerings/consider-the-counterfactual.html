            <h1>Steering 2 — Steelman Opposition</h1>

            <p><strong>Steer toward the strongest version of an opposing argument, not the weakest one.</strong></p>

            <p>Most bad decisions are not caused by stupidity or malice. They are caused by under-tested certainty. When opposition is caricatured, dismissed, or morally downgraded, systems lose the ability to correct themselves before reality intervenes.</p>

            <p>Steelman Opposition is the discipline of evaluating an idea by its best plausible case. If a policy or belief is sound, it should survive its strongest counterfactual—not just agreement from those already aligned.</p>

            <p>This Steering exists to prevent self-deception at scale.</p>

            <h2>Why Steelmanning Matters</h2>

            <p>As systems grow, disagreement becomes expensive. Coordination overhead increases, timelines compress, and dissent is increasingly treated as friction. Opposition is tolerated only in softened, symbolic form—stripped of force, urgency, or consequence.</p>

            <p><strong>The result is brittle consensus.</strong></p>

            <p>Steelmanning restores judgment by forcing engagement with trade-offs, second-order effects, and incentive structures before they manifest as failure. It replaces moral certainty with structural analysis.</p>

            <h2>Steelman Welfare</h2>

            <p>Welfare is a useful test case because it is emotionally charged, politically weaponised, and often discussed without serious counterfactual analysis.</p>

            <p>The strongest case for welfare is straightforward: people experience shocks. Illness, injury, job loss, family breakdown, or economic transition can temporarily remove their capacity to function. In those moments, support prevents collapse, preserves dignity, and allows recovery.</p>

            <p>This case is correct.</p>

            <p>Where systems fail is not in recognising this need, but in how the response is structured.</p>

            <h2>Maintenance Welfare vs Episodic Welfare</h2>

            <p>Steelman analysis reveals a critical distinction.</p>

            <p>Episodic welfare functions like a hospital. It intervenes intensely during crisis, focuses on recovery, and is explicitly designed to end. Its success condition is restoration of agency.</p>

            <p>Maintenance welfare functions like permanent care. It optimises for continuity, stability, and risk avoidance. Its success condition is ongoing eligibility.</p>

            <p>These are not morally equivalent systems. They select for radically different behaviours.</p>

            <h2>The Perverse Incentive</h2>

            <p>Maintenance welfare creates a structural incentive for failure to persist.</p>

            <p>Administrators, agencies, and programmes are funded based on volume, duration, and compliance. If dependency ends, budgets shrink. Careers stall. Institutions lose relevance. Solving the problem threatens the system designed to manage it.</p>

            <p>This does not require corruption. It emerges naturally from incentive design.</p>

            <p>Recipients adapt rationally as well. When survival depends on remaining eligible, recovery becomes risky. Agency is delayed. Dependency stabilises. What began as protection becomes constraint.</p>

            <p><strong>This is not compassion. It is misaligned design.</strong></p>

            <h2>Why Opposition Is Silenced</h2>

            <p>These dynamics are rarely discussed openly because steelmanning welfare exposes uncomfortable truths:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>that good intentions can produce harmful systems</li>
                <li>that moral certainty can block correction</li>
                <li>that incentives matter more than stated values</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As a result, criticism is often dismissed as cruelty rather than evaluated structurally. Opposition is moralised away instead of analysed.</p>

            <p>Steelman Opposition refuses that shortcut.</p>

            <h2>The Broader Lesson</h2>

            <p>This pattern is not unique to welfare. It appears wherever systems are built to manage risk indefinitely rather than resolve it: compliance regimes, safety cultures, regulatory bodies, and internal governance structures.</p>

            <p><strong>When success is defined as continuation, failure becomes necessary.</strong></p>

            <p>Steelmanning reveals this before the costs compound.</p>

            <h2>The Steering</h2>

            <p>Steering 2 does not tell you which side to take.<br>It tells you how to think.</p>

            <p>Before committing to any position, ask:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>what is the strongest version of the opposing case?</li>
                <li>what incentives does this system actually create?</li>
                <li>who benefits if the problem persists?</li>
                <li>what would success look like if recovery—not stability—were the goal?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Systems that cannot survive their strongest counterfactual are already broken.</p>

            <p>Steelmanning is how that becomes visible—before reality forces the correction.</p>

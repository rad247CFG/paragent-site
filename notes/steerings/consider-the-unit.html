            <h1>Steering 6 — Kings, Not Tyrants</h1>

            <p><strong>Distribute authority to enable action; do not retain control to prevent it.</strong></p>

            <p>Organisations do not fail because leaders lack intelligence or intent. They fail because authority is retained by those least exposed to consequence.</p>

            <p>As organisations scale, leadership often drifts from enabling action to preventing deviation. Control accumulates upward. Discretion is stripped downward. What remains is compliance without judgment and coordination without responsibility.</p>

            <p>Kings, Not Tyrants distinguishes two fundamentally different leadership postures. One catalyses agency. The other suppresses it.</p>

            <h2>Kings and Tyrants: A Structural Distinction</h2>

            <p>A King governs by enabling his people to act competently for the good of the realm. He provides resources, authority, and protection, and expects judgment in return. Power is exercised to increase the system's capacity to respond to reality.</p>

            <p>A Tyrant governs by retaining control to prevent actions he does not approve of. Authority is centralised, permission is required, and deviation is punished. Power is exercised to eliminate variance.</p>

            <p>The difference is not temperament or morality. It is trust.</p>

            <p>A King has reason to trust his people.<br>A Tyrant—even a benevolent one—has reason to fear them.</p>

            <p>That fear may be rational. Some people cannot be trusted. The failure is not recognising this, but responding by distrusting everyone.</p>

            <h2>Why Tyranny Feels Like Good Management</h2>

            <p>Tyranny feels responsible. Centralised control promises consistency, risk reduction, and predictability. Leaders gain visibility. Variance appears to shrink. Reporting improves.</p>

            <p>What actually shrinks is agency.</p>

            <p>As authority is pulled upward, information degrades. Context is flattened to fit abstractions. People closest to the work stop exercising judgment and start seeking permission. Action slows. Initiative disappears. Failure becomes systemic.</p>

            <p>At that point, behaviour shifts again. Safety no longer comes from solving the problem; it comes from following the process. People work to rule with blinders on, because compliance—not purpose—is what the system rewards.</p>

            <p>This is not because people are lazy or stupid. It is because the system has taught them that judgment is dangerous.</p>

            <h2>Selection Under Tyranny</h2>

            <p>Every structure selects for behaviour. Tyrannical systems select for compliance, escalation management, and blame avoidance. People who solve problems locally are treated as risks. People who preserve process are rewarded.</p>

            <p>Over time, the organisation fills with people optimised to survive the system rather than operate in reality. Fuckwittery is not introduced. It is selected.</p>

            <p>Intent does not matter. A tyrannical structure staffed with capable people still produces incompetence at scale.</p>

            <h2>Bad Actors and the Cost of Universal Distrust</h2>

            <p>Some people genuinely cannot be trusted. They act opportunistically, avoid responsibility, or abuse discretion. High-functioning systems identify these people and remove them.</p>

            <p>This is the essence of the "no Fuckwits" rule: not moral purity, but selective trust. Agency is extended broadly, then revoked decisively where it is abused.</p>

            <p>Most compliance-heavy systems do the opposite. They default to distrusting everyone, then attempt to manage risk by relocating authority far from the coal face. This protects the organisation from bad actors only superficially, while guaranteeing mediocrity everywhere else.</p>

            <p>Universal distrust is not risk management. It is capability destruction.</p>

            <h2>A Concrete Case: Amazon Prime and the FireStick</h2>

            <p>Amazon pushed a software upgrade to its Prime Video app on FireStick devices. The upgrade was incompatible with older hardware and broke those devices.</p>

            <p>As a customer, there was no choice to defer the upgrade and no ability to roll it back. Customer support had no authority to reverse it. Support staff also had no escalation path back to the engineering or IT team responsible for the change. The decision was unilateral, irreversible, and insulated.</p>

            <p>The outcome was that Amazon forced a hardware upgrade through a software decision, while the party responsible for the breakage faced no obligation to fix it.</p>

            <p><strong>This is tyranny in organisational form.</strong></p>

            <p>IT retained control to prevent deviation. Customer support absorbed consequences without authority. The customer lost agency entirely. The system was explicitly designed to insulate decision-makers from the effects of their own Fuckwittery.</p>

            <h2>The Same Pattern in Customer Service Theatre</h2>

            <p>The familiar sign stating that rudeness toward customer service staff will not be tolerated reflects the same structural failure.</p>

            <p>Customers become rude for a simple reason: they have a real problem, and the person they are speaking to cannot fix it. Either the staff member is forbidden to deviate from process, or the process itself does not resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>The sign attempts to regulate behaviour while preserving the underlying tyranny. It protects the system, not the people.</p>

            <p>This is not a civility problem. It is an authority and escalation problem.</p>

            <h2>Kings Decentralise by Design</h2>

            <p>A King does not micromanage outcomes. He ensures that authority sits where judgment is required and consequences are felt. He decentralises not because people are perfect, but because reality is local.</p>

            <p>In organisational terms, leaders who act like Kings:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Delegate real authority, not symbolic responsibility</li>
                <li>Preserve slack so judgment can be exercised</li>
                <li>Maintain escalation paths that force accountability back upward</li>
                <li>Remove bad actors rather than punishing everyone</li>
                <li>Treat agency as an amplifier, not a threat</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They do not fear deviation. They fear stagnation.</p>

            <h2>The Steering</h2>

            <p>Before retaining control, ask:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What action am I preventing, and why?</li>
                <li>Who is closest to the consequences of being wrong?</li>
                <li>What authority is required to resolve the issue, not just process it?</li>
                <li>Where does escalation force accountability back to the decision-maker?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Kings create conditions for competent action.<br>Tyrants create conditions for compliant failure.</p>

            <p>High-agency systems decentralise authority by default and recentralise only where irreversibility or externality demands it. They trade obedience for judgment and control for capability.</p>

            <p>A King is a catalyst for action.<br>A Tyrant is a constraint on it.</p>

            <h1>Steering 5 — Clean, Not Starve</h1>

            <p><strong>Preserve function by removing waste; do not suppress life to hide it.</strong></p>

            <p>When systems malfunction, the reflexive response is reduction: cut spending, cut headcount, cut access, cut activity. This presents as discipline. It is usually destruction.</p>

            <p>Starvation does not repair systems. It weakens them while preserving the conditions that caused failure.</p>

            <p>Clean, Not Starve begins with a structural claim: organisations are living systems. They operate through activity, not stasis. Attempts to improve them by broadly reducing activity mistake visibility for causality and restraint for competence.</p>

            <p>You do not starve the fish.<br>You clean the tank.</p>

            <h2>Why Starving Feels Responsible</h2>

            <p>Starvation seems viable only because it is legible. Numbers go down. Activity slows. Leaders can point to restraint without confronting causes.</p>

            <p>But starvation is indiscriminate. It removes signal with noise. It punishes competence along with waste. Over time it selects for behaviours that preserve energy rather than deploy it: risk aversion, deferral, compliance theatre. The system remains operational. Capability does not.</p>

            <p>This is not moral failure. It is selection pressure.</p>

            <h2>The Tank, Explicitly</h2>

            <p>Living systems generate residue as a consequence of operation. In a tank, this is waste. In organisations, it appears as friction: errors, rework, exceptions, coordination cost, and political residue.</p>

            <p>Attempting to reduce residue by suppressing activity does not produce cleanliness. It produces fragility.</p>

            <p>The same error appears when organisations pursue "waste reduction" through indiscriminate cutting. Removing genuine waste is beneficial. Eliminating all slack is not. Slack is not inefficiency; it is the capacity to absorb variance.</p>

            <p>When slack is eliminated, systems become tightly coupled. They perform well only under the assumptions that shaped them. Any deviation—delay, shock, or opportunity—propagates failure instead of being absorbed.</p>

            <p>Consider air travel. The most time-efficient itinerary minimises the gap between connecting flights. On average, transit time improves. In practice, the itinerary is fragile. A minor delay on the first leg causes the entire journey to fail. The schedule is efficient only if nothing goes wrong.</p>

            <p>Organisations designed this way optimise for steady state and collapse under variance.</p>

            <p>Cleanup is different. Cleanup removes accumulated residue while preserving adaptive capacity. It is work. It requires authority, effort, and continuous attention. Starvation avoids that work by redefining weakness as discipline.</p>

            <h2>Where This Logic Fails at Scale: Degrowth and the Donut</h2>

            <p>The same structural error appears in contemporary degrowth and "post-growth" agendas. Steelmanned, the proposal is simple: design an economy that guarantees a minimum universal standard of living while respecting an ecological ceiling. The "donut" defines a social floor and an environmental cap, with policy tasked to keep activity within the ring.</p>

            <p>The problem is not the intent. Systems fail by selection, not intent.</p>

            <p>Two questions expose the flaw.</p>

            <p><strong>First: who defines "enough"?</strong><br>Any declared minimum embeds contested moral judgments. What constitutes a decent life is not objective. For some, tax rates above 15% are indecent. For others, state-mandated ideological education is indecent. These disagreements are not peripheral; they are foundational. Degrowth frameworks require these questions to be settled centrally and rendered taboo to dispute. That is not coordination. It is suppression.</p>

            <p><strong>Second: who defines the ceiling?</strong><br>Ecological limits are not fixed. Technology reshapes consumption patterns and redefines scarcity. Solar panels reduce reliance on hydrocarbons while increasing demand for rare earths. The materials did not disappear; relative scarcity changed. Static ceilings become wrong as soon as innovation moves. Centralised caps cannot adapt at the speed of discovery. They lock yesterday's assumptions into today's rules.</p>

            <p>Degrowth proposes starvation as policy. It is Fuckwittery at a global scale: reducing agency everywhere to avoid the work of continuous cleanup—better technology, better incentives, better allocation. It appears prudent. It selects for stagnation.</p>

            <h2>Organisational Consequences of Starvation</h2>

            <p>Inside firms, starvation appears as blanket freezes, approval layers, and access restrictions justified as prudence. Cleanup is deferred because it is politically costly and hard to measure. Controls accumulate. Agency collapses.</p>

            <p>This produces a loop: deferred cleanup increases friction; friction increases error; error justifies more control; control reduces agency; reduced agency prevents cleanup. Fuckwittery accumulates not through malice, but through avoidance.</p>

            <h2>The Steering</h2>

            <p>Before cutting capacity, ask:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What residue is accumulating because no one is authorised to remove it?</li>
                <li>Which rules, roles, or approvals exist only to manage earlier mistakes?</li>
                <li>Where are incentives preserving mess to avoid conflict?</li>
                <li>Who has explicit mandate to clean continuously, not comply indefinitely?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Waste removal that preserves slack increases agency.<br>Waste removal that eliminates slack destroys it.</p>

            <p>High-functioning systems invest relentlessly in removal: obsolete rules, redundant coordination, misaligned incentives, and performative controls. This is hygiene, not optimisation.</p>

            <p>Agency is not a risk to be contained.<br>It is the amplifier that makes cleanup possible.</p>

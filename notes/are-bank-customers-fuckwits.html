            <h1>Are Bank Customers Fuckwits?</h1>

            <h2>1. The behaviour</h2>

            <p>Banks routinely offer honeymoon rates:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>New customers get better interest rates or lower fees</li>
                <li>Existing customers pay more for the same product</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Loyalty is penalised.<br>Churn is rewarded.</p>

            <h2>2. What the bank is actually betting on</h2>

            <p>The bank is making a rational bet:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Most customers will not notice</li>
                <li>Or will notice and not act</li>
                <li>Or will act and give up</li>
                <li>Or will feel awkward asking</li>
                <li>Or will assume "this is just how it is"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In short:</p>

            <p>The bank is betting customers lack agency.</p>

            <h2>3. Why this is an incentives failure</h2>

            <p>This is not customer service.<br>It is incentive design.</p>

            <p>The incentives say:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Optimise acquisition optics</li>
                <li>Externalise retention costs</li>
                <li>Exploit inertia and politeness</li>
                <li>Penalise trust and continuity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The bank is not confused.<br>It is rewarded internally for this behaviour.</p>

            <h2>4. The agency test</h2>

            <p>Honeymoon rates function as a filter.</p>

            <p>They separate customers into two groups:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Those who will ask, threaten to leave, or actually leave</li>
                <li>Those who will absorb the cost quietly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Banks extract rent from the second group to subsidise the first.</p>

            <p>This is not a relationship.<br>It is adverse selection.</p>

            <h2>5. Why this feels morally wrong</h2>

            <p>Humans evolved to expect:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fairness to loyalty</li>
                <li>Reciprocity over time</li>
                <li>Better treatment with trust</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Honeymoon pricing violates all three.</p>

            <p>That's why it feels like a betrayal, not a pricing strategy.</p>

            <h2>6. Why customers tolerate it</h2>

            <p>Most customers are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Busy</li>
                <li>Risk-averse</li>
                <li>Conflict-avoidant</li>
                <li>Unaware of alternatives</li>
                <li>Underestimating their leverage</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is learned helplessness, not stupidity.</p>

            <p>But from the bank's point of view, the distinction doesn't matter.</p>

            <h2>7. The Paragentic interpretation</h2>

            <p>A Paragentic customer does one of two things:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Demands parity</li>
                <li>Leaves</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Anything else reinforces the behaviour.</p>

            <p>From the bank's perspective:</p>

            <p>Customers who stay silent are signalling consent.</p>

            <h2>8. The uncomfortable conclusion</h2>

            <p>The system only works because:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Enough customers tolerate it</li>
                <li>Regulators allow it</li>
                <li>Switching costs feel high</li>
                <li>People confuse convenience with loyalty</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So the real question is not:</p>

            <p>"Are banks unethical?"</p>

            <p>It is:</p>

            <p>"Why does this strategy keep working?"</p>

            <h2>9. The answer</h2>

            <p>Because most customers do not act on their own behalf.</p>

            <p>Not because they are stupid.</p>

            <p>But because modern systems are built to exploit passivity.</p>

            <h2>10. Final line</h2>

            <p>Honeymoon rates are not a pricing strategy.<br>They are a test of agency.<br>The bank already knows most customers will fail it.</p>

            <h2>11. What breaks this model</h2>

            <p>Honeymoon pricing only works when customers are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Inattentive</li>
                <li>Friction-averse</li>
                <li>Individually negotiating</li>
                <li>Slow to act</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That condition is ending.</p>

            <h2>12. The rise of personal AI shoppers</h2>

            <p>Personal AI agents can already:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Monitor your products continuously</li>
                <li>Compare the full market in real time</li>
                <li>Detect when you are no longer on the best available rate</li>
                <li>Execute a switch automatically</li>
            </ul>

            <p>No phone calls.<br>No awkward conversations.<br>No "please can you match this."</p>

            <p>Just execution.</p>

            <h2>13. Why this collapses honeymoon pricing</h2>

            <p>Honeymoon pricing relies on inertia.</p>

            <p>AI eliminates inertia.</p>

            <p>From the bank's perspective, the world changes from:</p>

            <p>"Most customers won't bother"</p>

            <p>to:</p>

            <p>"All customers will leave instantly"</p>

            <p>That flips the incentives completely.</p>

            <h2>14. What banks will be forced to do</h2>

            <p>Once AI shoppers are common, banks must choose:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Offer the best rate you can afford to everyone</li>
                <li>Or accept continuous, automated churn</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The strategy of:</p>

            <p>"Reward acquisition, exploit loyalty"</p>

            <p>becomes unworkable overnight.</p>

            <h2>15. The deeper shift</h2>

            <p>This is not about better comparison websites.</p>

            <p>It is about delegated agency.</p>

            <p>People will no longer:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Track markets</li>
                <li>Negotiate</li>
                <li>Threaten to leave</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Their AI will do it continuously and unemotionally.</p>

            <p>Politeness stops being exploitable.</p>

            <h2>16. Why this generalises</h2>

            <p>Banks are not special.</p>

            <p>The same pressure applies to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Telcos</li>
                <li>Insurers</li>
                <li>Utilities</li>
                <li>SaaS subscriptions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Any industry built on customer passivity.</p>

            <p>Anywhere inertia is monetised, AI destroys margin.</p>

            <h2>17. The Paragentic angle</h2>

            <p>This is Paragentism made concrete.</p>

            <p>Not shouting.<br>Not protesting.<br>Not regulation-first.</p>

            <p>Just:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Clear rules</li>
                <li>Automated enforcement</li>
                <li>Exit without friction</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>18. Final line</h2>

            <p>Honeymoon rates survive only while customers negotiate like humans.<br>They collapse when customers act like systems.</p>

            <p>That technology already exists.</p>

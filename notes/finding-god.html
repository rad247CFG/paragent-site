            <h1>Finding God</h1>

            <h2>1. The problem religion solved</h2>

            <p>Religion solved one hard problem better than anything else for most of human history:</p>

            <p>How to trust an acquaintance almost as much as family.</p>

            <p>Family trust comes from predictability.<br>Religion manufactured predictability among non-kin.</p>

            <h2>2. The mechanism (simple, not mystical)</h2>

            <p>Religion did this by requiring people to follow the same small, repeatable rules:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Eat this, not that</li>
                <li>Take off your shoes here</li>
                <li>Say these words at meals</li>
                <li>Show up on these days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>None of this is costly.<br>All of it is binding.</p>

            <p>Once someone follows shared rules:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>They feel pressure to stay consistent (Cialdini's consistency principle)</li>
                <li>Others can predict their behaviour</li>
                <li>Trust forms quickly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Predictability is trust.</p>

            <p>Belief explains the rules later.<br>The rules create the trust.</p>

            <h2>3. From trust to coordinated agency</h2>

            <p>Once a group trusts internally, it gains immediate payoffs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Easier trade</li>
                <li>Risk sharing</li>
                <li>Enforceable discipline</li>
                <li>Long-term planning</li>
                <li>Coordinated violence if required</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A coordinated group can out-produce and out-fight a larger uncoordinated one.</p>

            <p>This is an agency multiplier.</p>

            <h2>4. Why religions expand</h2>

            <p>Once a religious pocket gains advantage, it expands.</p>

            <p>Expansion offers outsiders a narrow menu:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Assimilate (convert and adopt the rules)</li>
                <li>Submit (accept lower status)</li>
                <li>Leave</li>
                <li>Be destroyed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This pattern repeats everywhere in history.</p>

            <p>Belief follows survival.</p>

            <h2>5. Conversion is not ancient history</h2>

            <p>This is continuous, not medieval.</p>

            <p>Colonial Christian missionaries converted populations across Africa, the Americas, and the Pacific, often alongside force and administration.</p>

            <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints still runs a global, door-to-door conversion system.</p>

            <p>Hare Krishna movement recruits through public ritual and lifestyle adoption.</p>

            <p>The Catholic Church continues missionary expansion worldwide.</p>

            <p>Different doctrines.<br>Same mechanism.</p>

            <h2>6. Geography decides convergence or bloodshed</h2>

            <p>Where geography allows dominance, religions converge.</p>

            <p>Where geography blocks it, religions collide.</p>

            <p>Mountains, deserts, rivers, islands, and trade corridors mark religious fault lines.</p>

            <p>The conflicts were not about theology.<br>They were about which coordination system survives.</p>

            <h2>7. The built-in flaw</h2>

            <p>Religion's strength is also its failure.</p>

            <p>Rules become sacred.<br>Sacred rules cannot be criticised without weakening trust.</p>

            <p>At scale:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Identity replaces behaviour</li>
                <li>Symbols replace discipline</li>
                <li>Dogma outruns reality</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This produced wars, purges, forced conversions, caste systems, and persecution—harming or killing untold billions.</p>

            <p>This is not accidental.<br>It is structural.</p>

            <h2>8. Group cohesion requires an out-group</h2>

            <p>Strong cohesion requires a boundary.</p>

            <p>Every cohesive group needs someone to be "not us."</p>

            <p>Religion made this explicit.<br>Modern pseudo-religions pretend otherwise.</p>

            <p><strong>Christianity and homosexuality (direct)</strong></p>

            <p>Some Christian movements oppose homosexuality because it functions as a clean boundary marker:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Small, visible minority</li>
                <li>Permanently non-conforming</li>
                <li>Cannot "comply" their way out</li>
                <li>Maintains moral contrast cheaply</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is not primarily about sex.<br>It is about maintaining the edge of the in-group.</p>

            <p><strong>Australia, bloodless but real</strong></p>

            <p>The Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey showed this clearly:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Opposition clustered around religious conservatives</li>
                <li>Arguments framed marriage as sacred, not practical</li>
                <li>The vote functioned as an identity boundary test</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Same machinery.<br>Lower lethality.</p>

            <h2>9. Removing God did not remove religion</h2>

            <p>Modern societies did not remove religion.</p>

            <p>They tried to remove God.</p>

            <p>They got a long way.</p>

            <p>What remained was the religion module:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Shared rules</li>
                <li>Moral absolutes</li>
                <li>Identity signals</li>
                <li>Heresy policing</li>
                <li>Out-group punishment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These now appear as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Politics</li>
                <li>Nationalism</li>
                <li>Environmentalism</li>
                <li>Ideological atheism</li>
                <li>Lifestyle tribes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Same structure.<br>Different symbols.</p>

            <h2>10. China: Communism as the remaining religion</h2>

            <p>China did not become post-religious.</p>

            <p>It replaced religion with Communist Party of China.</p>

            <p>Communism there functions as an organised religion:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sacred texts and doctrine</li>
                <li>Rituals and anniversaries</li>
                <li>Moral absolutes</li>
                <li>Heresy punishment</li>
                <li>Missionary education and media</li>
            </ul>

            <p>God was removed.<br>The structure remained.</p>

            <p>That is why it still works.</p>

            <h2>11. Close-mindedness is a feature</h2>

            <p>Religion works because it limits permissible thought.</p>

            <p>Open criticism weakens shared rules.<br>Weak rules weaken trust.</p>

            <p>That trade-off shapes capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>The numbers (plain)</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>~15 million Jews worldwide</li>
                <li>~25% of Nobel Prizes in science</li>
                <li>~1.3 billion Muslims worldwide</li>
                <li>~0.03% of Nobel Prizes in science</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If prizes were random by population, these gaps would not exist.<br>A chi-squared test makes the probability of randomness effectively zero.</p>

            <p>This is not genetics.</p>

            <p>It reflects:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Education norms</li>
                <li>Tolerance for questioning</li>
                <li>Attitudes to dissent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>High coordination suppresses exploration.<br>Low coordination enables it.</p>

            <h2>12. The modern inflection</h2>

            <p>Religion was humanity's most successful trust technology—until networked systems like Tailpipe and blockchain made trust scalable without shared belief.</p>

            <p>Religion used conformity and exclusion.<br>Modern systems use records, rules, and verification.</p>

            <p>No gods required.</p>

            <h2>13. Why Paragentism is not a religion</h2>

            <p>Paragentism fails the core religious requirement:</p>

            <p>It has no stable out-group.</p>

            <p>Anyone who follows it will:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be wrong sometimes</li>
                <li>Act foolishly sometimes</li>
                <li>Contradict themselves sometimes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Everyone is a fuckwit at times.</p>

            <p>That makes Paragentism incompatible with religion:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>No permanent heretics</li>
                <li>No sacred identity</li>
                <li>No moral immunity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Cohesion is harder without enemies.<br>Badges or markers may help—but they must be:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Behaviour-based</li>
                <li>Revocable</li>
                <li>Time-limited</li>
                <li>Open to criticism</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The moment Paragentism defines a permanent "them", it collapses into the thing it rejects.</p>

            <h2>14. Final line</h2>

            <p>Religion was a brilliant coordination innovation.<br>It scaled trust, agency, and survival.</p>

            <p>It also froze belief and required enemies.</p>

            <p>God can disappear.<br>Religion does not.</p>

            <p>The only real question is whether we can now build trust systems that keep coordination without sacred ground, permanent out-groups, or immunity from criticism.</p>

            <p>That is what Finding God is actually about.</p>

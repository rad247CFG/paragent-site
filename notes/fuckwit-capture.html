            <p><strong>Why People Defend Systems That Reduce Their Agency</strong></p>

            <p>Most failing systems are not protected by force.<br>They are protected by the people inside them.</p>

            <p>This is the uncomfortable insight from the work of Slavoj &Zcaron;i&zcaron;ek: Systems persist not because people believe in them&mdash;but because they are rewarded for participating in them.</p>

            <p>The protection mechanism is psychological.</p>

            <h2>The Paradox</h2>

            <p>Low-performance environments often provide:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Safety without performance pressure</li>
                <li>Status without measurable outcomes</li>
                <li>Moral identity without operational responsibility</li>
                <li>Belonging through shared language and values</li>
                <li>Emotional energy through grievance, outrage, or virtue</li>
            </ul>

            <p>From the outside, the system looks inefficient or wasteful.<br>From the inside, it feels stable, meaningful, and morally justified.</p>

            <p>That feeling is the stabiliser.</p>

            <h2>Ideology in Practice</h2>

            <p>The common assumption is that systems survive because people believe in them.</p>

            <p>&Zcaron;i&zcaron;ek&rsquo;s insight is sharper:</p>

            <p><strong>People often know the system is flawed&mdash;but they continue to behave as if it works.</strong></p>

            <p>Because the behaviour pays.</p>

            <p>Examples:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Process replacing results</li>
                <li>Announcements replacing outcomes</li>
                <li>Cultural signalling replacing operational improvement</li>
                <li>Language of care replacing performance accountability</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The system does not require belief.<br>It requires participation.</p>

            <h2>Why Reform Fails</h2>

            <p>Most reform efforts target structure:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>New metrics</li>
                <li>New leadership</li>
                <li>New strategy</li>
                <li>New funding</li>
                <li>New programs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But if the current environment provides psychological reward, reform threatens:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Exposure</li>
                <li>Status</li>
                <li>Identity</li>
                <li>Comfort</li>
                <li>Predictability</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Resistance is not ignorance.<br>It is self-protection.</p>

            <p>People are defending their equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>The Stability Mechanism</h2>

            <p>This creates a durable condition:</p>

            <p>Low performance<br>+<br>Psychological comfort<br>=<br>Persistence</p>

            <p>Over time, people who value results leave.</p>

            <p>Those who remain are increasingly aligned with the environment.</p>

            <p>At that point, improvement pressure feels like attack.</p>

            <p>Failure is defended.<br>Accountability is resisted.<br>Language intensifies.</p>

            <h2>The Escalation Pattern</h2>

            <p>When performance problems appear, the response is often:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>More messaging</li>
                <li>More policy</li>
                <li>More visibility</li>
                <li>More moral positioning</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These actions restore psychological safety without increasing operational effectiveness.</p>

            <p>The system protects the feeling, not the function.</p>

            <h2>What This Means for Agency</h2>

            <p>You cannot change such a system by arguing that it is inefficient.</p>

            <p>Efficiency arguments threaten identity.</p>

            <p>Pressure increases defensiveness.<br>Evidence triggers justification.<br>Exposure produces moral escalation.</p>

            <p>Persuasion fails because the system is not organised around outcomes.<br>It is organised around emotional stability.</p>

            <h2>The Practical Response</h2>

            <p>Instead of trying to change the reward structure from inside:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Recognise the psychological payoff maintaining the system</li>
                <li>Expect resistance to performance pressure</li>
                <li>Avoid arguing efficiency against identity</li>
                <li>Increase your external options</li>
                <li>Shift your effort to the smallest environment where results still matter</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Agency grows through repositioning, not persuasion.</p>

            <h2>The Hard Truth</h2>

            <p>Most institutional dysfunction is not maintained by corruption or ignorance.</p>

            <p>It is maintained by ordinary people receiving enough psychological reward to tolerate low performance.</p>

            <p>Systems rarely change because people discover the truth.</p>

            <p>They change when the comfort of staying becomes lower than the cost of improving.</p>

            <h2>The Question</h2>

            <p>If a system is visibly underperforming, but the people inside feel safe, valued, and morally justified&mdash;</p>

            <p>Why would they want it to work better?</p>

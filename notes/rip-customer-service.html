            <h1>RIP Customer Service</h1>

            <h2>1. What happened</h2>

            <p>Customer service used to be a relationship.</p>

            <p>You had a problem. You called. A person answered. They fixed it or they didn't. Either way, you spoke to a human who could make a decision.</p>

            <p>That model is dead.</p>

            <p>It was not killed by technology.<br>It was killed by incentives.</p>

            <h2>2. The new model</h2>

            <p>Many large companies now route customer complaints through a system designed to do one thing:</p>

            <p>Make resolution more expensive than giving up.</p>

            <p>The tools are familiar:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chatbots that cannot resolve anything</li>
                <li>Phone trees that loop</li>
                <li>Hold times measured in hours</li>
                <li>Agents with no authority</li>
                <li>Ticket systems that lose context</li>
                <li>Escalation paths that do not escalate</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Not every company does this. Some get it right. But enough do it that the pattern is unmistakable.</p>

            <h2>3. The economics</h2>

            <p>Customer service is a cost centre.</p>

            <p>Every contact costs money. Every resolution costs more.</p>

            <p>The rational move is:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduce contacts</li>
                <li>Deflect complaints</li>
                <li>Delay resolution</li>
                <li>Exhaust the customer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Most customers will give up before the company's support system gives in.</p>

            <p>This is not a failure.<br>It is triage by frustration tolerance.</p>

            <h2>4. Why it got worse, not better</h2>

            <p>Technology made customer service cheaper to deliver badly — but consistently.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chatbots cost less than call centres</li>
                <li>Automated responses cost less than chatbots</li>
                <li>No response costs nothing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Of course, the cheapest customer support is not creating the need for support in the first place. But that requires caring about the product more than the margin.</p>

            <p>Each generation of tooling reduced the cost of deflection while maintaining the appearance of availability.</p>

            <p>The company still has a "Contact Us" page.<br>It may or may not lead somewhere useful.</p>

            <h2>5. The complaint rate trick</h2>

            <p>Companies measure complaint volumes.</p>

            <p>When complaint volumes drop, they report success.</p>

            <p>But volumes can drop for two reasons:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The problem was solved</li>
                <li>Customers stopped trying</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Most complaint reduction is the second kind.</p>

            <p>Activity is measured. Outcome is not.<br>The metric improves while the problem worsens.</p>

            <h2>6. The human cost</h2>

            <p>Customers are not just inconvenienced.</p>

            <p>They are conditioned.</p>

            <p>After enough failed attempts to resolve a problem, most people learn:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Calling is pointless</li>
                <li>Complaining is exhausting</li>
                <li>Switching feels risky</li>
                <li>Acceptance is easier</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is learned helplessness applied commercially.</p>

            <p>The company did not solve the problem.<br>It solved the complaining.</p>

            <p>At one point, the Commonwealth Bank's call wait time to reach a human was approximately eight hours. That meant you could not get through before the bank closed, so you were forced to use CEBA — their AI chatbot. CEBA is about as smart as a bag of rocks and has no power to resolve anything. The loop was complete: you could not reach a person, and the machine could not help.</p>

            <h2>7. Why frontline staff cannot help</h2>

            <p>The people answering phones are not the problem.</p>

            <p>They are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Underpaid</li>
                <li>Undertrained</li>
                <li>Given scripts instead of authority</li>
                <li>Measured on call time, not resolution</li>
                <li>Penalised for escalating</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The system is designed so that the person you reach cannot help you, and the person who could help you cannot be reached.</p>

            <p>But this is not universal.</p>

            <p>Amazon's customer service is generally good — they resolve most issues quickly, with real authority at the front line. The exception is IT-related problems, where they fall into the same loops as everyone else.</p>

            <p>AliExpress is the opposite. Support is slow, formulaic, and often useless.</p>

            <p>eBay has taken a different path entirely: they offer almost no customer support at all, except to refund you if you cannot work it out with the vendor directly. It is a system that outsources resolution to the marketplace.</p>

            <p>The variation matters. It proves this is a design choice, not an inevitability.</p>

            <h2>8. The Fuckwit layer</h2>

            <p>Between the customer and anyone with authority sits a layer of middle management optimising for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cost per contact</li>
                <li>Average handle time</li>
                <li>Deflection rate</li>
                <li>Complaint closure rate</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These metrics reward exactly the wrong behaviour.</p>

            <p>A complaint closed without resolution counts the same as one closed with resolution. A customer who gives up counts the same as one who is satisfied.</p>

            <p>The Fuckwit does not need to lie.<br>They just need to report the metric.</p>

            <h2>9. What AI changes for customers</h2>

            <p>We predict the rise of the personal AI complaint and support bot.</p>

            <p>Your AI agent will not:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Get tired</li>
                <li>Feel awkward</li>
                <li>Accept the first answer</li>
                <li>Lose track of a case</li>
                <li>Give up after forty minutes on hold</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It will:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Document every interaction</li>
                <li>Escalate systematically</li>
                <li>File regulatory complaints automatically</li>
                <li>Switch providers without hesitation</li>
                <li>Publish outcomes at scale</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The company's entire deflection architecture is built to exhaust humans.</p>

            <p>AI does not exhaust.</p>

            <h2>10. The asymmetry flips</h2>

            <p>Right now, the company uses automation against the customer.</p>

            <p>AI gives the customer the same weapon.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Company deploys a chatbot → customer's AI navigates it instantly</li>
                <li>Company creates a phone tree → customer's AI maps it and bypasses it</li>
                <li>Company delays response → customer's AI follows up continuously</li>
                <li>Company offers a bad resolution → customer's AI benchmarks it against the market and rejects it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For the first time, the cost of deflection rises faster than the cost of resolution.</p>

            <h2>11. What companies will be forced to do</h2>

            <p>When AI agents handle complaints:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deflection stops working</li>
                <li>Bad resolutions get published</li>
                <li>Churn becomes instant</li>
                <li>Reputation damage becomes measurable and attributable</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Companies will face a choice:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Solve problems quickly and cheaply</li>
                <li>Or pay more to not solve them than it would have cost to fix them</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The economics flip.<br>Resolution becomes the cheaper option.</p>

            <h2>12. Why this is Paragentic</h2>

            <p>Customer service died because passivity was profitable.</p>

            <p>Paragentism does not ask companies to be nicer.</p>

            <p>It changes the conditions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complaints that cannot be ignored</li>
                <li>Exits that cannot be prevented</li>
                <li>Outcomes that cannot be hidden</li>
            </ul>

            <p>No regulation required.<br>No outrage required.<br>Just agency, delegated and persistent.</p>

            <h2>13. Final line</h2>

            <p>Customer service was not murdered by greed.<br>It was optimised away by a system that discovered most people will accept being ignored.</p>

            <p>AI does not accept being ignored.</p>

            <p>That changes everything.</p>

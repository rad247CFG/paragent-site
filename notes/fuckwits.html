            <h1>Fuckwits</h1>

            <p><strong>A functional definition, not a slur</strong></p>

            <p>A Fuckwit is a bad person—but not in the way people usually mean.</p>

            <p>A Fuckwit is not defined by intelligence, temperament, or intent. A Fuckwit is someone who consistently erodes agency—their own or others'—while advancing their position inside a system. What makes this definition uncomfortable is that Fuckwits are often locally rational and institutionally rewarded.</p>

            <p>As organisations scale, they naturally attract more Fuckwits. This is not a moral failing; it is a selection effect. Large systems create abstraction, insulation, and asymmetry. These conditions favour actors who externalise risk, defer responsibility, and exploit process rather than outcome. Over time, such behaviour outcompetes competence.</p>

            <p>Importantly, Fuckwits are not limited to employees. They appear everywhere a system interfaces with the world:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>customers who exploit policy</li>
                <li>suppliers who arbitrage ambiguity</li>
                <li>channel partners who free-ride</li>
                <li>regulators who optimise for optics</li>
                <li>external publics who reward signalling over substance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The common organisational response is predictable: deploy Fuckwittery internally. More rules. More approvals. More controls. More compliance. These mechanisms are intended to constrain Fuckwits.</p>

            <p><strong>This response is a systemic error.</strong></p>

            <p>Fuckwittery does not suppress Fuckwits; it amplifies them. Rule-dense environments advantage those most willing to game, hide behind, or weaponise process. Competent operators slow down or disengage. Over time, the organisation becomes safer—and stupider.</p>

            <p>The key mistake is treating Fuckwits as a risk to be constrained rather than a strategy to be made unviable.</p>

            <p>Paragentism takes the opposite approach: design systems where Fuckwittery does not pay. When incentives align agency with outcome, Fuckwits lose leverage. They are not expelled; they become irrelevant. Their behaviour stops working.</p>

            <p>This is not about moral purification. It is about changing the selection pressure.</p>

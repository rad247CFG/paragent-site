            <h1>Deadly Choices</h1>

            <h2>1. What it is</h2>

            <p>Deadly Choices is a government-funded public health campaign.</p>

            <p>One visible element is outdoor advertising, including billboards on buses, depicting a pregnant woman addressing the baby in her womb and stating that she is quitting smoking because it is good for both of them.</p>

            <p>The stated objective is to reduce smoking during pregnancy.</p>

            <p>That objective is legitimate.</p>

            <h2>2. How programs like this are typically justified</h2>

            <p>Government campaigns of this type are usually justified using proxy measures such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Impressions</li>
                <li>Reach</li>
                <li>Awareness</li>
                <li>Visibility</li>
                <li>Engagement metrics</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are easy to count.<br>They are politically legible.<br>They are not the outcome.</p>

            <p>The outcome is behavioural change:</p>

            <p>fewer pregnant women smoking.</p>

            <p>If that outcome is not directly measured, the program cannot demonstrate success.</p>

            <h2>3. The targeting problem</h2>

            <p>Outdoor advertising targets the general population to reach a very narrow group.</p>

            <p>The actual target audience is:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Pregnant women</li>
                <li>Who smoke</li>
                <li>Who are undecided</li>
                <li>Who are receptive to messaging</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is a tiny fraction of viewers.</p>

            <p>As a result:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Most impressions are irrelevant</li>
                <li>Cost per relevant exposure is extremely high</li>
                <li>Attribution to behaviour change is weak or impossible</li>
            </ul>

            <p>High-precision channels already exist:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>GP clinics</li>
                <li>Antenatal clinics</li>
                <li>Hospitals</li>
                <li>Pharmacies</li>
                <li>Baby stores</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These environments contain the exact audience at the exact moment decisions are made, at far lower cost per relevant exposure.</p>

            <p>Choosing mass advertising over point-of-care intervention prioritises visibility over efficiency.</p>

            <h2>4. Why this is moral theatre</h2>

            <p>Moral theatre has three characteristics:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>High public visibility</li>
                <li>Low accountability for outcomes</li>
                <li>Emotional signalling in place of measurement</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This campaign fits that pattern.</p>

            <p>That does not make it evil.<br>It does make it an immoral waste of taxpayer money.</p>

            <p>Spending public funds without a credible mechanism to measure behavioural impact diverts resources from interventions that could actually work.</p>

            <h2>5. The incentive failure</h2>

            <p>Public programs are structurally rewarded for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Spending their allocated budget</li>
                <li>Being seen to act</li>
                <li>Avoiding political risk</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They are not rewarded for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Solving the problem permanently</li>
                <li>Making themselves unnecessary</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that a cheaper approach worked better</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If a program truly eliminated the problem it exists to address, it would undermine its own future funding.</p>

            <p>This creates a perverse but rational outcome:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Activity is safer than effectiveness</li>
                <li>Continuity is safer than success</li>
                <li>Spending is safer than solving</li>
            </ul>

            <p>No malice is required.<br>Only incentives.</p>

            <h2>6. Why some problems are chosen and others avoided</h2>

            <p>Certain behaviours are safer to campaign against than others.</p>

            <p>They:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Have clear moral framing</li>
                <li>Involve a visually sympathetic subject</li>
                <li>Do not provoke strong political backlash</li>
                <li>Allow public virtue signalling at low risk</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other health problems with larger population impact but higher political sensitivity are quietly avoided.</p>

            <p>This is not a health optimisation strategy.<br>It is a risk management strategy.</p>

            <h2>7. What a serious approach would look like</h2>

            <p>A serious approach would:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Treat behaviour change as an optimisation problem</li>
                <li>Fund multiple competing interventions</li>
                <li>Measure outcomes, not impressions</li>
                <li>Rapidly kill what does not work</li>
                <li>Scale what does</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An open competition for effective interventions, with the rights to test and deploy all submitted ideas, would outperform a single centrally designed campaign at a fraction of the cost.</p>

            <h2>8. Why this matters</h2>

            <p>Taxes are not high only because needs are great.</p>

            <p>They are high because large amounts of spending are protected by moral cover rather than evidence.</p>

            <p>When programs cannot be questioned without being framed as uncaring, waste becomes untouchable.</p>

            <p>That is the real damage of moral theatre.</p>

            <h2>9. Final question</h2>

            <p>If the goal is to save lives, could this money have been spent in ways that actually saved some?</p>

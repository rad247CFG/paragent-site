            <h1>Buffered Society</h1>

            <p>Today, several pressure points consistent with Turchin&rsquo;s framework are visible.</p>

            <h2>Elite Overproduction</h2>

            <p>Credential production appears to exceed stable apex roles.</p>

            <p>Example: PhD expansion in many Western countries has coincided with replacement of full-time post-graduate employment by contract and adjunct roles.</p>

            <p>In corporate governance, concentration patterns are visible. According to the 2025 Board Diversity Index in Australia:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Just 18% of female directors hold 43% of all female-occupied seats in the ASX 300.</li>
                <li>Roughly 30% of top board seats are occupied by interlocked directors.</li>
                <li>Around 25% of directors with multiple seats have backgrounds in the &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; professional services firms.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This suggests elite recycling rather than broad turnover.</p>

            <h2>Rising Public Debt</h2>

            <p>In both the United States and Germany, interest payments on public debt are approaching levels comparable to military expenditure. Fiscal strain is not hypothetical.</p>

            <h2>Political Polarization</h2>

            <p>In the United States, partisan polarization between Republicans and Democrats has reached levels not seen for decades.</p>

            <h2>Expanding Bureaucracy</h2>

            <p>In Australia, government expenditure is roughly 35% of GDP, rising to over 40% if mandatory superannuation is included. The state footprint is large and persistent.</p>

            <p>Under classical Turchin expectations, such conditions could precede instability and reset.</p>

            <p>Instead of immediate collapse, however, we observe a different pattern:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Slower long-term growth rather than sharp breakdown.</li>
                <li>Institutional thickening&mdash;expansion of rules, oversight, compliance layers.</li>
                <li>Continued debt accumulation and absorption rather than fiscal crisis.</li>
                <li>Welfare cushioning that reduces visible immiseration.</li>
                <li>Elite exit rather than revolt: high-capability individuals shifting sectors, jurisdictions, or into private capital rather than contesting institutional hierarchies.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The key difference is not absence of pressure, but absence of rupture.</p>

            <h2>Buffered Society?</h2>

            <p>My hypothesis is that modern systems possess buffering mechanisms that delay Turchin-style collapse.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bureaucracy absorbs elite aspirants into mid-level roles.</li>
                <li>Debt postpones fiscal reckoning.</li>
                <li>Welfare dampens unrest.</li>
                <li>Compliance expansion slows competitive turnover.</li>
                <li>Mobility allows exit rather than confrontation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The system metabolizes pressure instead of releasing it through shock.</p>

            <p>This does not prove collapse will not occur.</p>

            <p>It suggests it is being dragged out.</p>

            <p>The COVID-19 shock reinforces this ambiguity. A global crisis produced massive fiscal and monetary intervention rather than systemic breakdown. Either structural thresholds were not fully reached, or buffering capacity is stronger than historical precedent.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Turchin</h2>

            <p>Is collapse avoidable?</p>

            <p>Turchin assumes elite density must eventually fall relative to elite roles.</p>

            <p>An alternative pathway is to change incentives.</p>

            <p>Instead of elite reduction, elite aspirants are incentivised to start businesses rather than compete for hierarchical slots.</p>

            <p>If high-capability individuals redirect ambition toward entrepreneurship:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hierarchy widens.</li>
                <li>Apex roles multiply through firm creation.</li>
                <li>Status competition diffuses into market competition.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This does not eliminate hierarchy. It increases permeability.</p>

            <h2>Necessary Conditions</h2>

            <p><strong>Lower individual taxes</strong> because retained capital is required to accumulate startup equity and absorb risk.</p>

            <p><strong>Lower barriers to firm creation</strong> because friction pushes aspirants back into job-land competition. Mandatory procurement shares from new firms, scaling with revenue, could widen opportunity access.</p>

            <p><strong>Differential regulation by size</strong> because uniform compliance regimes advantage large firms that can amortize costs. Regulation scaled to revenue rather than applied uniformly reduces entry deterrence and incentivises fragmentation. Since Fuckwittery expands with scale, it should contract with fragmentation.</p>

            <p><strong>Stronger coupling and constraints on scale</strong> because insulation protects incumbents. Larger entities&mdash;especially government&mdash;should face stricter performance coupling, not looser oversight.</p>

            <p><strong>Leadership replacement</strong> because incentive culture flows downward. Leaders who reward agency expansion redirect ambition into productive competition. Our current leadership does not seem motivated to do this.</p>

            <h2>Structural Pessimism</h2>

            <p>The position advanced here requires less overhead, different risk management, and more sensible moral goals. This can create significant efficiency improvement&mdash;reducing unnecessary administrative layers and compliance drag to free capital across the economy. Jurisdictions that achieve this could gain substantial comparative advantage. The country most often cited is Singapore.</p>

            <p>Frankly I am pessimistic about the potential for structural improvement.</p>

            <p>Elites in power often act to concentrate agency rather than broaden it. Redistribution can be electorally decisive. After removing double-counting, approximately 38&ndash;42% of Australian households receive at least one redistributive transfer annually, excluding schooling and hospital services. In a system where a 3&ndash;6% swing can change a federal election outcome, redistribution has dominated structural efficiency reform.</p>

            <p>If regulation continues to scale uniformly and incumbents benefit from compliance complexity, entrepreneurial fragmentation may not outpace elite density. In banking, Australia has seen few genuine new major entrants in decades beyond institutional conversions. The UK has at least seen challengers such as Dave Fishwick&rsquo;s community bank initiative.</p>

            <p>Paragentism partly emerges from my lived experience of elite competition frustration. That admission does not invalidate the structural analysis. It clarifies motive: seeking structural escape rather than accepting elite pruning as inevitable.</p>

            <h2>The Summary</h2>

            <p>Turchin predicts collapse when elite density outruns structure.</p>

            <p>The Buffered Society hypothesis suggests collapse can be delayed.</p>

            <p>Beyond Turchin proposes that redirecting elite ambition into enterprise may avoid pruning.</p>

            <p>Whether that pathway is viable depends on whether incentives shift before pressure forces correction. History would suggest don&rsquo;t bet on improvements, bet on a forced correction.</p>

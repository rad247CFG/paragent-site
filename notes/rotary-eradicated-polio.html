            <h1>Rotary Eradicated Polio</h1>

            <p>This is a Third Thought about success. It shows what happens when agency, incentives, and consequences are aligned—and why most government welfare and UN programs fail precisely because they are not.</p>

            <h2>The Outcome</h2>

            <p>Polio has been reduced by more than 99.9% worldwide and eliminated in almost every country. This is not a disputed result, a modelling claim, or a reframed metric. It is a concrete, falsifiable outcome: cases went to zero in most of the world.</p>

            <p>That did not happen because of moral consensus, universal compliance, or centralized command.</p>

            <p>It happened because Rotary acted as a distributed agency system with a terminal goal.</p>

            <h2>What Rotary Did Differently</h2>

            <p>Rotary did not operate as a welfare bureaucracy. It operated as a network of voluntary agents with ownership.</p>

            <p>Its defining characteristics were:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clear end-state:</strong> eradicate polio, then stop</li>
                <li><strong>Local agency:</strong> action taken by people embedded in their own communities</li>
                <li><strong>Voluntary participation:</strong> no entitlement, no coercion</li>
                <li><strong>Reputational skin in the game:</strong> success and failure were visible to peers</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome dominance:</strong> effort only mattered if it reduced cases</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This structure forced learning. If something did not work, it was changed or abandoned. There was no moral cover for persistence without results.</p>

            <h2>Not Sacrifice — Investment</h2>

            <p>Rotarian involvement is often framed as altruism or self-sacrifice. That framing is misleading.</p>

            <p>Rotarians were investing in a better society they themselves would live in:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>healthier communities</li>
                <li>functioning local health capacity</li>
                <li>global disease suppression that protected everyone</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The payoff was not abstract virtue. It was a safer, more functional world. Systems that rely on sacrifice fail. Systems that convert effort into shared upside scale.</p>

            <h2>Why This Is Damning for Welfare and UN Programs</h2>

            <p>If a government or UN welfare program ever actually solved a major social problem in a durable way, it would be impossible to miss. It would be studied, replicated, and endlessly cited.</p>

            <p>We cannot find such examples.</p>

            <p>Instead, most welfare programs exhibit the opposite traits:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>no terminal condition</li>
                <li>no personal ownership</li>
                <li>no reputational cost for failure</li>
                <li>funding persistence regardless of outcomes</li>
                <li>moral framing that substitutes for feedback</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They are designed to continue, not to finish.</p>

            <h2>The Paragentic Lesson</h2>

            <p>Rotary eradicated polio because it was allowed to end.</p>

            <p>If government welfare programs were organised like Rotary, they would either solve the problem or cease to exist.</p>

            <p>Rotary eradicated polio because it was allowed to finish.</p>

            <p>Large-scale problems do not require moral superiority or centralized control. They require agency, aligned incentives, and the freedom for success to make the system obsolete.</p>

            <p>That is Paragentism, demonstrated.</p>

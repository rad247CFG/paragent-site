            <h1>Size Doesn&rsquo;t Matter &mdash; The Agency Thesis</h1>

            <h2>1. Big Firms Don&rsquo;t Innovate. Bigger Markets Do.</h2>

            <p>The common claim:</p>

            <p>Large firms struggle to innovate. Innovation is risky. It has front-loaded cost. It has long payback periods. Big firms become big by avoiding asymmetric downside.</p>

            <p>Conclusion often drawn:</p>

            <p><strong>Size kills innovation.</strong></p>

            <p>But compare that to the market.</p>

            <p>The market is vastly larger than any firm. More complex. More interconnected. More exposed to shocks.</p>

            <p>Yet it innovates continuously.</p>

            <p>If size or complexity were the root cause, the market would stagnate.</p>

            <p>It does not.</p>

            <p>So size is not the root cause.</p>

            <h2>2. The Root Cause Is Agency</h2>

            <p>The difference between a big firm and a big market is not scale.</p>

            <p>It is whether agency is constrained or released.</p>

            <p><strong>In a Big Firm</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Capital is unified.</li>
                <li>Risk tolerance is flattened.</li>
                <li>Decision authority is centralised.</li>
                <li>Failure is political.</li>
                <li>Alignment precedes experimentation.</li>
                <li>Innovation must survive internal immune response.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>In the Market</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Capital pools are plural.</li>
                <li>Risk tolerance varies.</li>
                <li>Decision authority is distributed.</li>
                <li>Failure is local.</li>
                <li>Experimentation precedes alignment.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Innovation density remains high because agency is released.</p>

            <p>The corporate innovation problem is an agency problem.<br>Not a size problem.<br>Not a complexity problem.</p>

            <h2>3. Regulation Retards Small Firms More Than Big Ones</h2>

            <p>Industry regulation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Raises fixed compliance costs.</li>
                <li>Requires reporting and licensing.</li>
                <li>Increases legal exposure.</li>
                <li>Slows entry.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Large firms:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Amortise compliance.</li>
                <li>Employ legal teams.</li>
                <li>Influence rule design.</li>
                <li>Absorb overhead.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Small firms:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bear the same rules.</li>
                <li>Cannot amortise fixed cost.</li>
                <li>Face disproportionate friction.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Regulation selects for scale. It concentrates production. It suppresses entry. It retards small firms more than large ones.</p>

            <h2>4. Redistributive Income Tax Retards Surplus Accumulation</h2>

            <p>Entrepreneurship requires surplus, risk capital, and equity accumulation.</p>

            <p>High marginal individual income tax:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Extracts surplus at source.</li>
                <li>Reduces retained capital.</li>
                <li>Reduces optionality.</li>
                <li>Delays or prevents transition from job taker to job maker.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Corporate tax, by contrast:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Is levied on profit (income minus costs).</li>
                <li>Allows deductions.</li>
                <li>Enables capital reinvestment before tax.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Structurally:</p>

            <p>Individual income tax resembles a revenue tax.<br>Corporate tax resembles a profit tax.</p>

            <p>Individuals are taxed earlier in the capital formation chain.</p>

            <p>This asymmetry concentrates capital in firms, reduces individual equity accumulation, and suppresses startup formation.</p>

            <h2>5. The Structural Cascade</h2>

            <p>Less startup formation leads to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fewer small firms.</li>
                <li>Larger share of economy in big firms.</li>
                <li>More production concentration.</li>
                <li>More bureaucratic behaviour.</li>
                <li>More fuckwittery.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This leads to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>More people working in big firms.</li>
                <li>Fewer employer choices.</li>
                <li>Less labour competition.</li>
                <li>Lower wage pressure.</li>
                <li>Fewer purchasing options.</li>
                <li>Lower spending power.</li>
                <li>Lower quality of life.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Concentration amplifies itself.</p>

            <p>Agency contracts system-wide.</p>

            <h2>6. The Left and the Right Both Miss It</h2>

            <p><strong>The Left Error</strong></p>

            <p>Focus on redistribution to job takers. Increase welfare flows. Increase income taxation.</p>

            <p>But suppress startup density.</p>

            <p>More job takers. Fewer job makers. More dependence.</p>

            <p><strong>The Right Error</strong></p>

            <p>Expand rule complexity in the name of order. Increase regulatory layers. Strengthen enforcement surface area.</p>

            <p>But increase compliance overhead. Select for scale. Suppress entry.</p>

            <p>Both sides increase concentration.</p>

            <p>Neither addresses agency.</p>

            <h2>7. Equalising the Structural Bias</h2>

            <p>Currently:</p>

            <p>Individual income tax &asymp; revenue tax.<br>Corporate tax = income &minus; costs.</p>

            <p>Companies reduce taxable income through deduction. Individuals cannot deduct capital formation.</p>

            <p>This structurally advantages firms over individuals.</p>

            <p><strong>One structural correction:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduce individual income tax substantially.</li>
                <li>Increase consumption tax.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Effects:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Retained individual surplus increases.</li>
                <li>Equity formation increases.</li>
                <li>Startup density increases.</li>
                <li>Capital is taxed at spend, not at formation.</li>
                <li>Transfer pricing avoidance becomes less relevant (tax tied to local consumption).</li>
                <li>Tax burden equalises more closely between individuals and firms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. The Fairness Objection</h2>

            <p>Criticism: Consumption tax is regressive. Low-income individuals spend a higher proportion of income.</p>

            <p>Paragentism does not prioritise fairness as an outcome metric.</p>

            <p>But even on pragmatic grounds:</p>

            <p>If startup density increases:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>More firms.</li>
                <li>More competition for labour.</li>
                <li>Higher wages structurally.</li>
                <li>More purchasing choice.</li>
                <li>More price competition.</li>
                <li>Less corporate dominance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Then low-income workers may benefit from:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Increased labour scarcity.</li>
                <li>Increased bargaining power.</li>
                <li>Lower effective prices.</li>
                <li>Greater mobility.</li>
                <li>Less exposure to big corporate fuckwittery.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is structural improvement, not transfer improvement.</p>

            <h2>9. Final Chain</h2>

            <p>Less income tax on individuals<br>
            &rarr; More surplus retention<br>
            &rarr; More entrepreneurs<br>
            &rarr; More small firms<br>
            &rarr; More labour demand fragmentation<br>
            &rarr; Higher wages<br>
            &rarr; More purchasing options<br>
            &rarr; More competition<br>
            &rarr; Less concentration<br>
            &rarr; Less fuckwittery<br>
            &rarr; Higher quality of life</p>

            <p>Agency compounds.</p>

            <h2>Core Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Big firms do not innovate.</p>

            <p>Bigger markets do.</p>

            <p>The difference is agency.</p>

            <p>Regulation and income redistribution, as currently structured, suppress agency and concentrate production.</p>

            <p>Less startup density increases corporate dominance.</p>

            <p>Both Left redistribution and Right rule expansion increase concentration.</p>

            <p>Prosperity is not improved by fairness theatre or rule proliferation.</p>

            <p>It is improved by releasing agency.</p>

            <p>Size doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

            <p>Constraint does.</p>

            <h1>Leveraging Agency for Scale</h1>
            
            <p><strong>Paragentism</strong> is a framework for designing systems where agency scales instead of collapsing. It treats organisations as mechanical systems shaped by incentives, feedback, and decision rights—not as cultural or moral projects. The objective is simple: align incentives so judgment distributes naturally, allowing people to act intelligently without waiting for permission. This is not philosophy or leadership theatre. It is a practical approach to increasing leverage by turning human judgment into a scalable asset.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The problem</strong> is one of perspective. Follower agency is usually treated as a risk rather than an amplifier. Risks are constrained; amplifiers are powered. Most organisations respond to uncertainty by adding controls, rules, and approvals—attempting to suppress variance instead of harnessing it. This is how agency is eroded. Paragentism adopts the opposite perspective: when incentives are aligned to outcomes, agency becomes reach. Leaders do not constrain their right hand; they strengthen it. Systems should do the same.</p>
